# States: a list of tuples, (-1, -1) for dead-end state

# Actions: a tuple of two tuples, denoting moving from one state to another
# transition: a dictionary of...
#   keys: a tuple denoting the current state
#   values: a dictionary with...
#       keys: a tuple of two tuples, denoting actions
#       values: a dictionary with...
#           keys: a tuple denoting the next state
#           values: a double denoting the probability of transitioning to that state
# Costs: A dictionary with...
#       keys: a tuple denoting the state
#       values: a dictionary with....
#           keys: a tuple of two tuples denoting actions
#           values: a dictionary with...
#               keys: a tuple denoting the state ending up at
#               values: a cost in the form of distance, as in the paper.
